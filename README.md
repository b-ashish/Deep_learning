# Security Camera Object Detection Using OpenCV


## Overview
This project is a Security Camera Object Detection System implemented using OpenCV, a powerful open-source computer vision library. The system enhances security surveillance by providing real-time object detection and tracking capabilities.

## Features
Real-time Object Detection: Utilize OpenCV algorithms to perform object detection in real-time from the camera feed.
Multi-Object Tracking: Track the movement and paths of detected objects, enabling comprehensive monitoring.
Customizable Object Classes: Define and customize object classes based on specific security requirements.
Alerting and Notifications: Trigger alerts and notifications for predefined security events such as unauthorized entry or object removal.
Region of Interest (ROI) Configuration: Define specific regions of interest within the camera feed to focus detection efforts.
Integration with Existing Security Infrastructure: Seamlessly integrate with existing CCTV cameras and monitoring systems.
Scalability: Deploy the system across multiple cameras for comprehensive coverage.
OpenCV Algorithms for Accuracy: Achieve high accuracy in object detection, even in challenging lighting conditions.
Logging and Reporting: Maintain detailed logs of detected objects, allowing for historical analysis.
Privacy Features: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations by masking or anonymizing sensitive areas within the camera feed.
